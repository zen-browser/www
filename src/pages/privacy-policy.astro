    <p>
      Zen Browser is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or
      share any of your personal data. Here’s what that means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Crash reports can be sent to Mozilla Firefox. But, we do not collect any
        crash reports. Crash reports are sent securely to Mozilla Firefox to
        help improve the stability of the browser. They do not contain any
        personal information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </h3>
    <p>We do not collect any telemetry data.</p>
    <p>
      However, you can opt-in to share telemetry data to Mozilla for the
      improvement of FireFox (the base upon which the Zen Browser is built). It
      will be treated in accordance with their Privacy Policy which you can read
      about <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/">here</a>.

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl !font-bold" id="-1-2-no-personal-data-collection-">
      <strong class="font-bold">1.2. No Personal Data Collection</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Zen Browser does not collect any personal information such as your IP
      address, browsing history, search queries, or form data.

      We do not allow third-party trackers or analytics tools to operate within

      shared with any third party. Mozilla is not considered a third party as it
      is the base of Zen Browser.

    <Title class="mt-16 !text-4xl font-bold" id="3-sync-feature"
      >3. Sync Feature</Title
    >
    <p>
      Zen Browser offers a &quot;Sync&quot; feature, which is implemented using
      Mozilla Firefox&#39;s Sync feature. This feature allows you to synchronize
      your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other data across multiple
      devices. For this feature to work, your data is encrypted and stored on
      Mozilla’s servers and is treated in accordance with their Privacy Policy.
      We, at Zen, cannot view any of this data.
    </p>

      Although Zen Browser does not collect your data, we are committed to
      protecting the information that is stored locally on your device and, if
      you use the Sync feature, the encrypted data stored on Mozilla&#39;s
      servers. We recommend that you use secure passwords, enable device
      encryption, and regularly update your software to ensure your data remains
      safe.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Note that most of the security measures are taken care by Mozilla
        Firefox.
