  "This update includes window sync and other nice improvements! Window sync is a way to keep your windows organized across multiple monitors. If you want a blank window, you can do so by using opt+cmd+N (for mac), ctrl+alt+N (for linux) and alt+N (for windows). Enjoy!\n\nYou can read more about window sync in our documentation <a class=\"text-coral\" href=\"https://docs.zen-browser.app/user-manual/window-sync\">here</a>",
